      "    Notes\n",
      "    -----\n",
      "    ``MT19937`` provides a capsule containing function pointers that produce\n",
      "    doubles, and unsigned 32 and 64- bit integers [1]_. These are not\n",
      "    directly consumable in Python and must be consumed by a ``Generator``\n",
      "    or similar object that supports low-level access.\n",
      "\n",
      "    The Python stdlib module \"random\" also contains a Mersenne Twister\n",
      "    pseudo-random number generator.\n",
      "\n",
      "    **State and Seeding**\n",
      "\n",
      "    The ``MT19937`` state vector consists of a 624-element array of\n",
      "    32-bit unsigned integers plus a single integer value between 0 and 624\n",
      "    that indexes the current position within the main array.\n",
      "\n",
      "    The input seed is processed by `SeedSequence` to fill the whole state. The\n",
      "    first element is reset such that only its most significant bit is set.\n",
      "\n",
      "    **Parallel Features**\n",
      "\n",
      "    The preferred way to use a BitGenerator in parallel applications is to use\n",
      "    the `SeedSequence.spawn` method to obtain entropy values, and to use these\n",
      "    to generate new BitGenerators:\n",

      "    >>> rg = [Generator(MT19937(s)) for s in sg.spawn(10)]\n",

      "    :math:`2^{128}` random numbers have been generated ([1]_, [2]_). This\n",
      "    allows the original sequence to be split so that distinct segments can be\n",
      "    used in each worker process. All generators should be chained to ensure\n",
      "    that the segments come from the same sequence.\n",

      "    >>> rg = []\n",
