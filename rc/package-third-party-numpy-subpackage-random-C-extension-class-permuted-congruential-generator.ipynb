      "    -----\n",
      "    PCG-64 is a 128-bit implementation of O'Neill's permutation congruential\n",
      "    generator ([1]_, [2]_). PCG-64 has a period of :math:`2^{128}` and supports\n",
      "    advancing an arbitrary number of steps as well as :math:`2^{127}` streams.\n",
      "    The specific member of the PCG family that we use is PCG XSL RR 128/64\n",
      "    as described in the paper ([2]_).\n",
      "\n",
      "    ``PCG64`` provides a capsule containing function pointers that produce\n",
      "    doubles, and unsigned 32 and 64- bit integers. These are not\n",
      "    directly consumable in Python and must be consumed by a ``Generator``\n",
      "    or similar object that supports low-level access.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Supports the method :meth:`advance` to advance the RNG an arbitrary number of\n",
      "    steps. The state of the PCG-64 RNG is represented by 2 128-bit unsigned\n",
      "    integers.\n",
      "\n",
      "    **State and Seeding**\n",
      "\n",
      "    The ``PCG64`` state vector consists of 2 unsigned 128-bit values,\n",
      "    which are represented externally as Python ints. One is the state of the\n",
      "    PRNG, which is advanced by a linear congruential generator (LCG). The\n",
      "    second is a fixed odd increment used in the LCG.\n",
      "\n",
      "    The input seed is processed by `SeedSequence` to generate both values. The\n",
      "    increment is not independently settable.\n",
      "\n",
      "    **Parallel Features**\n",
      "\n",
      "    The preferred way to use a BitGenerator in parallel applications is to use\n",
      "    the `SeedSequence.spawn` method to obtain entropy values, and to use these\n",
      "    to generate new BitGenerators:\n",
      "\n",
      "    >>> from numpy.random import Generator, PCG64, SeedSequence\n",

      "    **Compatibility Guarantee**\n",
