      "    This class is similar to `rv_continuous`. Whether a shape parameter is\n",

      "    that its arguments are strictly positive.)\n",
      "    The main differences are:\n",
      "\n",
      "    - the support of the distribution is a set of integers\n",
      "    - instead of the probability density function, ``pdf`` (and the\n",
      "      corresponding private ``_pdf``), this class defines the\n",
      "      *probability mass function*, `pmf` (and the corresponding\n",
      "      private ``_pmf``.)\n",
      "    - scale parameter is not defined.\n",
      "\n",
      "    To create a new discrete distribution, we would do the following:\n",

      "    >>> class poisson_gen(rv_discrete):\n",
      "    ...     \"Poisson distribution\"\n",

      "    ...         return exp(-mu) * mu**k / factorial(k)\n",
      "\n",
      "    and create an instance::\n",
      "\n",
      "    >>> poisson = poisson_gen(name=\"poisson\")\n",
      "\n",
      "    Note that above we defined the Poisson distribution in the standard form.\n",
      "    Shifting the distribution can be done by providing the ``loc`` parameter\n",
      "    to the methods of the instance. For example, ``poisson.pmf(x, mu, loc)``\n",
      "    delegates the work to ``poisson._pmf(x-loc, mu)``.\n",
      "\n",
      "    **Discrete distributions from a list of probabilities**\n",
      "\n",
      "    Alternatively, you can construct an arbitrary discrete rv defined\n",
      "    on a finite set of values ``xk`` with ``Prob{X=xk} = pk`` by using the\n",
      "    ``values`` keyword argument to the `rv_discrete` constructor.\n",
